  <p>There are three coloured squares. Two are floated left, and one is floated right. Note that the second "left" square is placed to the right of the first. Additional squares would continue to stack to the right, until they filled the containing box, after which they would wrap to the next line. A floated element is at least as tall as its tallest nested floated children. We gave the parent width: 100% and floated it to ensure it is tall enough to encompass its floated children, and to make sure it takes up the width of the parent so we don't have to clear its adjacent sibling.</p>
